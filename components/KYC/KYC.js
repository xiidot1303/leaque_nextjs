                        The Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for managing financial crime
                        risks and making improvements in financial crime risk management through
                        identifying the general and specific money laundering risks that Leaque is
                        facing, determining how these risks are mitigated by the Leaque AML controls
                        and establishing the residual risk that remains for Leaque.

                        Leaque AML and KYC Policy sets out Leaque risk appetite with regard to
                        AML/KYC. To reduce this risk Leaque does not accept clients who are resident
                        in countries deemed to be above the Leaque risk appetite.
